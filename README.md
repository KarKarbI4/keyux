# KeyUX

JS library to improve keyboard UI of web apps. It was designed not only
for **a11y** but also to create **professions tools** where users prefer
using keyboard.

* Add **hotkeys** support by `aria-keyshortcuts`.
* Show button’s `:active` state when user press hotkey.
* Enable <kbd>↑</kdb>/<kbd>↓</kdb>/etc navigation in `role="menu"` lists.
* Jump to next section according to `aria-controls` and back by <kbd>Esc</kbd>.
* Show/hide submenus of `role="menu"`.
* **1 KB** (minified and brotlied). No dependencies.
